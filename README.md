# Project: Explanatory Data Visualization with Tableau 
## Survival on the Titanic

For introduction see `P8.ipynb` file.

In addition you can download the Tableau file saved in `P8.twbx`.

### Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Here we are looking at 891 passengers’ information.

Out of 891 passengers only 342 of them (%38) survived and 549 not. Most of survived and not survived people belong to ages between 15 to 40. Although the same number of males and females had died, but female passengers had survived the shipwreck almost four times more than male passengers.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
In this explanatory visualization, I have shown the passengers distribution on board and illustrate how different situation and parameters affected their survival chance.
